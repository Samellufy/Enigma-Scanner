What are Security headers?

Security headers are HTTP headers that web servers use to enhance the security of web applications by providing additional layers of protection against various types of attacks. These headers are sent as part of the HTTP response from the server to the client's browser and instruct the browser on how to handle certain aspects of the web page. Here's a brief explanation of each of the headers you mentioned:
1. Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):
Purpose: Enforces the use of HTTPS by instructing the browser to always load the website over a secure, encrypted connection.
Example: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains

2. Content-Security-Policy (CSP):
Purpose: Defines a policy to control which resources are allowed to be loaded on a web page, mitigating risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Example: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-scripts.com

3 .X-Frame-Options:
Purpose: Prevents a web page from being embedded within an iframe, providing protection against clickjacking attacks.
Example: X-Frame-Options: DENY

4. X-Content-Type-Options:
Purpose: Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than declared by the server, reducing the risk of certain types of attacks, such as MIME-sniffing.
Example: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

5 .Referrer-Policy:
Purpose: Controls how much information is included in the HTTP referer header when navigating from one page to another. This helps to protect user privacy.
Example: Referrer-Policy: no-referrer

6 .Permissions-Policy:
Purpose: Allows a website to control which browser features can be used and by whom. It helps in limiting the capabilities of web pages, enhancing security and privacy.
Example: Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(self "https://example.com")
